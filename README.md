#For  Bar Ilan University_DevSecOps_HangingMan project.

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game,

1. the user needs to guess a quote by inputting one letter at a time.

2.The game displays a quote with each letter replaced by an underscore,  the user needs to guess the missing letters.

3.The game keeps track of the user's score and penalizes incorrect guesses, while awarding points for correct ones.

4.The game also includes a bonus for completing the quote in less than 30 seconds.

5.The implementation code is in Python and utilizes functions, loops, and conditional statments to implement the game logic.
